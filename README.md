### Test Strategy
As part of Functional Testing, we will follow the below approach for Testing:

<b>Step #1</b> – Creation of Test Scenarios and Test Cases for the different features in scope.

<b>Step #2</b> – Our Testing process, when we get an Application for Testing:
1. Firstly, we will perform Smoke Testing to check whether the different and important functionalities of the application are working.
2. We reject the build, if the Smoke Testing fails and will wait for the stable build before performing in depth testing of the application functionalities.
3. Once we receive a stable build, which passes Smoke Testing, we perform in depth testing using the Test Cases created.
4. Multiple Test Resources will be testing the same Application on Multiple Supported Environments simultaneously.
5. We then report the bugs in bug tracking tool and send dev. Management the defect found.
6. As part of the Testing, we will perform the below types of Testing:
7.	Smoke Testing and Sanity Testing
8.	Regression Testing and Retesting 
9.	Usability Testing, Functionality & UI Testing 
We repeat Test Cycles until we get the quality product.

<b>Step #3</b> – We will follow the below best practices to make our Testing better:
1.	End-to-End Testing – We will test the end-to-end scenario which involve multiple functionalities to simulate the end user flows.
